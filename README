Locks/unlocks Linux shared memory segments in RAM, so they're never swapped.
(This is linux only. In BSD, use sysctl kern.ipc.shm_use_phys)

Usage: shm_rampin [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -l               locks shared memory segments
  -u               unlocks shared memory segments
  -i <shmid>       performs the action in a specific shmid
                   (ipcs -m for a list)
  -U <user_name>   performs the action in all the shmems that
                   belong to a given user
  -h               displays this help message


For instance to lock all the shared memory segments that belong to
the `postgres` user in RAM:

    shm_rampin -l -U postgres

And to unlock them:

    shm_rampin -u -U postgres
